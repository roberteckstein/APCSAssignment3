# AP CS Text-based Adventure Game

Note from teacher: never store Java class files in the source repository (e.g., anything in the "out" directory). Always let the user rebuild the Java class files targeted to the particular version of the JDK that they're using. (BTW, you should not be using a JDK later than version 8.)

##Note from dean:
Level one is now finshed and playable, I don't think there are any bugs and I connected it to level 2. Also for level 2 and 3 people I added a way to teleport instantly to your starting rooms for play-testing purposes. For level 2 it's: "go l2" and for level 3 it's: "g l3." It only works from the starting room so make sure you do it from there. When the game is finished we can delete them.
